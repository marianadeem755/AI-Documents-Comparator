- **Side-by-side previews** with keyword highlighting (e.g., *Actual, Revised, Change*).

### Report Generation
- **PDF**: Landscape-formatted with tables and styled content (via ReportLab).  
- **DOCX**: Structured Word reports (via python-docx).  
- **TXT**: Plain text summary with formatted tables.
